# Resident Evil 7 Autosplitter
Instructions:

Edit your splits and change the game name to "Resident Evil 7". A message should pop up saying an autosplitter by me is available. Click "Activate".

After activating the RE7 autosplitter, click "Settings". Place a checkmark next to every split you want to use.

Afterwards, create your splits. Name them anything you want (just make sure they correspond with a checkmarked autosplit). Order them however you'd like.

Make sure you compare against Game Time.

Any problems? Reach out to me.

# I already used your old version, will my splits still work?

Yup. Disable "scriptable autosplitter" in your layout. From there, edit the old splits names to whatever you'd like.
